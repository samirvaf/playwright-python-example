# Playwright Python Example

This repository shows how to exercise the QBench order workflow with
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python) and `pytest`.  The focus is on
functional UI tests.

> **Note**
> Playwright's Python bindings do not include native visual regression
> capabilities.  Integrating screenshot comparisons would require an external
> library, so this example omits that feature.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the dependencies and Playwright browsers:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

Environment variables `BASE_URL`, `USER_EMAIL`, and `USER_PASSWORD` may be
stored in a `.env` file or exported in the shell. The continuous integration
workflow expects these values to be provided through repository secrets.

## Running the tests

Execute the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Traces, screenshots, and videos are retained on failure by default.

## Project architecture

The code follows a simple Page Object Model:

- `tests/` contains pytest test cases.
- `ui/pages/` defines highâ€‘level pages such as the login and order pages.
- `ui/sections/` holds smaller widgets used within pages.
- `ui/components/` contains reusable helpers like spinners and toasts.

## Extending the project

Future improvements could include:

- Adding more form fields with corresponding assertions.
- Introducing teardown logic that deletes created orders through API
  requests.
- Writing a new test that proves a Lab ID cannot be reused by creating an
  order through the API and attempting to reuse the same Lab ID via the UI.
